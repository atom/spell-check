# Spell Check package
[![OS X Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/spell-check.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/spell-check) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1620a5reqw6kdolv/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/spell-check/branch/master) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/atom/spell-check.svg)](https://david-dm.org/atom/spell-check)

Highlights misspelling in Atom and shows possible corrections.

Use <kbd>cmd-shift-:</kbd> to bring up the list of corrections when your cursor is on a misspelled word.

By default spell check is enabled for the following files:

* Plain Text
* GitHub Markdown
* Git Commit Message
* AsciiDoc
* reStructuredText

You can override this from the _Spell Check_ settings in the Settings View (<kbd>cmd-,</kbd>). The Grammars config option is a list of scopes for which the package will check for spelling errors.

To enable _Spell Check_ for your current file type: put your cursor in the file, open the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette)
(<kbd>cmd-shift-p</kbd>), and run the `Editor: Log Cursor Scope` command. This will trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope that's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings for the _Spell Check_ package. Here are some examples: `source.coffee`, `text.plain`, `text.html.basic`.

## Changing the dictionary

To change the language of the dictionary, set the "Locales" configuration option to the IETF tag (en-US, fr-FR, etc). More than one language can be used, simply separate them by commas.

For Windows 8 and 10, this package uses the Windows spell checker, so you must install the language using the regional settings before the language can be chosen inside Atom. Otherwise you can set the `SPELLCHECKER_PREFER_HUNSPELL` environment variable to request the use of the built-in hunspell spell checking library.

## Plugins

_Spell Check_ allows for plugins to provide additional spell checking functionality. See the `PLUGINS.md` file in the repository on how to write a plugin.
